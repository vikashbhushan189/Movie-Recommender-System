This repository contains an advanced movie recommendation system developed in Python. It's designed to be modular, efficient, and interactive via a Streamlit web application.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Popularity-Based Chart:** Recommends top-rated movies using a robust weighted rating formula, preventing bias from movies with few ratings.
-   **Content-Based Filtering:**
    -   **Plot Similarity:** Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) on movie plot overviews.
    -   **Metadata Similarity:** Leverages CountVectorizer on combined features like cast, director, keywords, and genres.
    -   Incorporates advanced text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopwords removal) for higher quality textual features.
-   **Collaborative Filtering:** Employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on user-item rating data for personalized recommendations.
-   **Hybrid Recommendation:** Combines collaborative filtering with content-based similarity to offer more comprehensive recommendations, adapting to user preferences and movie features.
-   **Modular Design:** Core logic is encapsulated in the `MovieRecommender` class (`api.py`), enabling clean separation of concerns.
-   **Efficient Model Loading:** Utilizes `pickle` to serialize and deserialize preprocessed data and trained models, ensuring rapid startup for the Streamlit app.
-   **Interactive Web Application (Streamlit):** A user-friendly interface allows real-time interaction with different recommendation types.

## üìä Key Results & Performance (Metrics)

Below are some aggregated performance metrics from the evaluation phase, showcasing the effectiveness of different recommendation approaches. Metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and F1-Score@K indicate the relevance of the top `K` recommendations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-movie-recommender.git
    cd your_movie_recommender
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-surprise nltk streamlit
    ```

4.  **Download NLTK Data:**
    NLTK requires some data for text preprocessing.
    ```bash
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
    ```

5.  **Download Datasets:**
    This project uses subsets of the [MovieLens Latest Small Dataset (ml-latest-small.zip)](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and [The Movies Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). Please download the following CSV files and place them into a `./data/` directory within your project root:
    -   `movies_metadata.csv` (from Kaggle)
    -   `credits.csv` (from Kaggle)
    -   `keywords.csv` (from Kaggle)
    -   `ratings_small.csv` (from MovieLens Latest Small, inside ml-latest-small.zip)
    -   `links.csv` (from MovieLens Latest Small, inside ml-latest-small.zip)

    Your `data/` directory should look like this:
    ```
    your_movie_recommender/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ movies_metadata.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credits.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keywords.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ratings_small.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ links.csv
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  **Generate/Update Saved Models:**
    The `MovieRecommender` class will automatically attempt to load pre-processed data and trained models from `./saved_models_deploy/`. If these files don't exist or are outdated, the system will re-run the full preprocessing and training pipeline (which takes several minutes) and save the new models.

    You can explicitly trigger this or ensure models are saved by running `api.py` once:
    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```
    This command initializes the `MovieRecommender` class, processes the data, trains the models (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, SVD), and saves the results to `./saved_models_deploy/`.

2.  **Start the Streamlit Application:**
    Once the models are saved (or after the `api.py` execution completes its initial setup), you can launch the interactive recommender web application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
    This command will open the Streamlit app in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
